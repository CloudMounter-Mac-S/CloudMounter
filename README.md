## Overview

<a href="#">CloudMounter</a> delivers seamless cloud storage integration through local drive mounting capabilities. The application serves users managing multiple cloud accounts requiring unified file access.

Drive mounting presents cloud storage as network volumes appearing in Finder sidebar alongside local drives. Users access cloud files through familiar interface without launching separate <a href="#">web browsers</a> or applications.

Multiple service support encompasses Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and S3. Simultaneous account mounting provides <a href="#">unified access</a> to diverse cloud storage consolidating management.

File operations work identically to local handling with standard Finder actions. Applications open cloud files directly without manual <a href="#">download procedures</a> maintaining workflow efficiency.

Client-side encryption protects data during transmission and storage. Security measures prevent unauthorized access even with <a href="#">compromised accounts</a> ensuring data protection.

Bandwidth controls limit transfer speeds preventing network saturation. Traffic management maintains responsive <a href="#">network performance</a> for other activities during synchronization.

Offline caching enables continued work without connectivity. Frequently accessed files remain available during <a href="#">network outages</a> with automatic synchronization.

Large file handling supports multi-gigabyte transfers reliably. Progress tracking and resume capabilities manage <a href="#">interrupted transfers</a> efficiently.

Automatic connection management maintains stable cloud links. Session renewal and error recovery proceed without <a href="#">manual intervention</a> reducing authentication frustration.

WebDAV protocol compatibility extends support beyond mainstream providers. Any compatible server mounts as local drive supporting <a href="#">diverse infrastructures</a>.
